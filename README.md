# XFM2_patches
json patch files for the XFM2

The json file format is easy to understand.
Main part is just Par#:value for all parameters.

Main advantage of the json file is you are free to expand it as long as the *parameters* part is intact you can use the json file to upload a patch to the XFM2

Second interesting use is you could only set a selection of the  parameters in a json file so only these parameters are overwritten when uploaded to the XFM2. 

In the patches/DX7_algorithms folder you find the patches to set the operators according the 32 DX7 algorithms.
Other usage is to create effects presets, see patches/effects
